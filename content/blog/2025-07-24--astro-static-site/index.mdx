In this post I would like to talk not just about Astro, but about having a blog or some kind of portfolio. 
Maybe I do have imposter syndrome to think that my posts are not worth to read, or to say "who am i to teach other people, or what interesting thing do I have". 

First and foremost, blog is just for yourself. Yes, people have access to that, you won't be writing any crazy idea that you usually write on your diary.
You learn something useful, or some great inspiration comes to mind, so you fix that in some place - your personal web-site. Not in a paper that you will probably lose. If someone reads that, it's great. 

Secondly, one, who seeks to offer some kind of service online, should definitely have personal site with personal projects.
It gives great convinience for you and the one who is interested in partnership with you. 
Having glance at your site, he will more easily make decision whether to have a deal.

Maybe the title of this post should have been something like "10 reasons you should have personal site".
What I have constituted so fare were reasons for my discovery of Astro.


I have heard of Jekkyl that is written in Ruby. As I have a knowledge on Javascript, I have decided to look at frameworks written in JS.
I started installing Hugo, after typing installation command I have noticed that golang would be installed. Oh, that's not what I needed. For unknown reason I had a wrong information about Hugo.
Finally, I have found Astro. 

So, what I love about Astro? It's written in Javascript and just npm is needed to have it installed.


Then I started searching for themes, to have some minimal blog layout. Cloned it from github, installed pnpm to run it and that's it. I have blog. Thanks to the author of this theme, his credentials placed at the footer.
