The first thing I learned working in computer was cutting my body in a picture then placing it in a picture of a beach. All of it was done in Adobe Photoshop CS4. That time I have made many stuff with Photoshop, it had 3D module as well. I used to create 3d model of bottle. Not from scratch, it was built-in feature.
I had some vision. I used to plan to learn 3Ds Max to model 3D shapes and make movies, make my own 3d anime.
