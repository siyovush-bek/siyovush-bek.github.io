## Welcome 👋🏻

I publish my thoughts, ideas and findings. Soon there will be section with posts related to my personal projects.
So this place will be a portfolio-website as well.

Shortly about the blog itself. It takes advantage of ready to use theme developed for [Astro](https://astro.build/). Link to the author placed in a footer.

The site itself is deployed into Github Pages via Github Actions.
